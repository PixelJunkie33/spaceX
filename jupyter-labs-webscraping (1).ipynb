This was due to one of the nine <a href=\"/wiki/SpaceX_Merlin\" title=\"SpaceX Merlin\">Merlin engines</a> shutting down during the launch, and NASA declining a second reignition, as per <a href=\"/wiki/International_Space_Station\" title=\"International Space Station\">ISS</a> visiting vehicle safety rules, the primary payload owner is contractually allowed to decline a second reignition. NASA stated that this was because SpaceX could not guarantee a high enough likelihood of the second stage completing the second burn successfully which was required to avoid any risk of secondary payload's collision with the ISS.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-OrbcommTotalLoss_32-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-OrbcommTotalLoss-32\">[26]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-sn20121011_33-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-sn20121011-33\">[27]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-34\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">[28]</a></sup>\n","</td></tr>\n","<tr>\n","<th rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\">5\n","</th>\n","<td>1 March 2013,<br/>15:10\n","</td>\n","<td><a href=\"/wiki/Falcon_9_v1.0\" title=\"Falcon 9 v1.0\">F9 v1.0</a><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-MuskMay2012_13-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MuskMay2012-13\">[7]</a></sup><br/>B0007.1<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-block_numbers_14-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-block_numbers-14\">[8]</a></sup>\n","</td>\n","<td><a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station\" title=\"Cape Canaveral Space Force Station\">CCAFS</a>,<br/><a href=\"/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_40\" title=\"Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40\">SLC-40</a>\n","</td>\n","<td><a href=\"/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-2\" title=\"SpaceX CRS-2\">SpaceX CRS-2</a><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-sxManifest20120925_28-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-sxManifest20120925-28\">[22]</a></sup><br/>(Dragon C104)\n","</td>\n","<td>4,877 kg (10,752 lb)\n","</td>\n","<td><a href=\"/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit\" title=\"Low Earth orbit\">LEO</a> (<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/ISS\" title=\"ISS\">ISS</a>)\n","</td>\n","<td><a href=\"/wiki/NASA\" title=\"NASA\">NASA</a> (<a href=\"/wiki/Commercial_Resupply_Services\" title=\"Commercial Resupply Services\">CRS</a>)\n","</td>\n","<td class=\"table-success\" style=\"background: #9EFF9E;
